% pts, is an integer, 

% but amp, f1, and f2 and are not necessarily integers

% Output argument s1 is a row vector \
% whose length (number of elements) equals pts.

% s1 are the values of the sine contains f1 periods
% s2 contains f2 periods

% sums is the sum of s1 and s2

% If f2 is omitted, then it should be set to a value that is 5% greater than f1.
% If f1 is omitted also, then it should be set to 100
% If amp is not provided, then it should default to 1
% if pts is omitted as well, then it should be set to 1000.

function [s1, s2, sums] = sines(pts,amp,f1,f2)
    
end
